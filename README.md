# Stepstone Job Finder

## Requirements

* Python >= 3.9
* Installed packages: BeautifulSoup, Tkinter
* Internet access for http requests

## Tips

* In the moment this website is only useful to search jobs in Germany, the Netherlands or Belgium on Stepstone
* The key word lets you select jobs where the job title or job description contains the key word

## Next steps

* Include more Job websites and more countries
* Full navigation in Tkinter instead of opening the web browser
* More pre-filtering options such as salary, employee ratings, skill requirements etc

Have fun with my programme and good luck finding your dream job!
